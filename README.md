# Data Context and Setup

This repository contains scripts and configurations for initializing data projects with clean, consistent, and reproducible environments. It is designed to streamline the setup process for analytics and data engineering workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- Organized folder structure for data projects
- Configurations for Python virtual environments (e.g., `pyenv`, `poetry`)
- Sample data ingestion and preprocessing logic
- Environment management for reproducibility
- Support for scalable extension into ETL pipelines or ML workflows

## Objectives of the module

We will analyze a dataset provided by an e-commerce marketplace called **Olist** to answer the CEO's question:

> How could Olist increase its profit?

## About Olist 🇧🇷

<img src="https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/best-practices/olist.png" width="500"/>

Olist is a leading e-commerce service that connects merchants to main marketplaces in Brazil. They provide a wide range of offers including inventory management, dealing with reviews and customer contacts to logistic services.

Olist charges sellers a monthly fee. This fee is progressive with the volume of orders.

Here are the seller and customer workflows:

**Seller:**

- Seller joins Olist
- Seller uploads products catalogue
- Seller gets notified when a product is sold
- Seller hands over an item to the logistic carrier

👉 Note that multiple sellers can be involved in one customer order!

**Customer:**

- Browses products on the marketplace
- Purchases products from Olist.store
- Gets an expected date for delivery
- Receives the order
- Leaves a review about the order

👉 A review can be left as soon as the order is sent, meaning that a customer can leave a review for an order he did not receive yet!

## Dataset

The dataset consists of ~100k orders from 2016 and 2018 that were made on the Olist store, available as csv files on Le Wagon S3 bucket (❗️the datasets available on Kaggle may be slightly different).

✅ Download the 9 datasets compressed in the `olist.zip` file, unzip it and store them in your `~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv` folder:

```bash
curl https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/olist/olist.zip > ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/olist.zip
unzip -d ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/ ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/olist.zip
rm ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv/olist.zip
```

Check you have the 9 datasets on your machine:

```bash
ls ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}/data/csv
```

## Setup

### 1 - Project Structure
Go to your local `~/code/<user.github_nickname>/04-Decision-Science` folder.
This will be your project structure for the week.

```bash
.
├── 01-Project-Setup
│   │   # Your whole code logic and data, this is your "package"
│   ├── data-context-and-setup
│   │   ├── data                # your data source (git ignored)
│   │   │   ├── csv
│   │   │   │   ├── olist_customers_dataset.csv
│   │   │   │   ├── olist_orders_dataset.csv
│   │   │   │   └── ...
│   │   │   └── README.md       # database documentation
│   │   │
│   │   └── olist               # your data-processing logic
│   │       ├── data.py
│   │       ├── product.py
│   │       ├── seller.py
│   │       ├── utils.py
│   │       └── __init__.py     # turns the olist folder into a "package"
│   │
│   │   # Your notebooks & analyses, day-by-day, challenge-by-challenge
│   ├── data-data-preparation
│   └── data-exploratory-analysis
├── 02-Statistical-Inference
│   └── ...
├── 03-Linear-Regression
│   └── ...
└── 04-Logistic-Regression
    └── ...
```

### 2 - Edit the `PYTHONPATH`

Add `olist` path to your `PYTHONPATH`.

This will allow you to easily import modules defined in `olist` in your notebooks throughout the week.

Open your terminal and navigate to your home directory by running:

```bash
cd
```

Now you'll need to open your `.zshrc` file. As you might have noticed the file starts with a dot which means it's a hidden file. To be able to see this file in your terminal you'll need to run the command below, the flag `-a` will allow you to see hidden files:

```bash
ls -a
```

Next lets open the file using your text editor:

```bash
code .zshrc
```

Now in your terminal run:
```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }} && echo "export PYTHONPATH=\"$(pwd):\$PYTHONPATH\""
```

👉 Copy the resulting output line from your terminal and paste it at the bottom of your ~/.zshrc file. Don't forget to save and restart all your terminal windows to take this change into account.



### 🔥 Check your setup

Go to your **home folder** and run an `ipython` session:

```bash
cd
ipython
```

Then type the following to check that the setup phase from the previous exercise worked:

```python
from olist.data import Olist
Olist().ping()
# => pong
```

If you get something else than `pong`, raise a ticket to get some help from a TA. You might have a problem with the `$PYTHONPATH`.

## Push your code on GitHub

From your `{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}` directory, commit and push your code:

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{ local_path_to("04-Decision-Science/01-Project-Setup/01-Context-and-Setup") }}
git add .
git commit -m 'kick off olist challenge'
git push origin master
```
